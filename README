= id3lib-ruby

id3lib-ruby provides a Ruby interface to the id3lib C++ library for easily
editing ID3 tags (v1 and v2) like with pyid3lib.

The class documentation starts at ID3Lib::Tag.


== Features

* Read and write ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags
* Simple interface for adding, changing and removing frames
* Quick access to common text frames like title and performer
* Custom data frames like attached picture (APIC)
* Pretty complete coverage of id3lib's features
* UTF-16 support (warning: id3lib writes broken UTF-16 frames)
* Windows binary gem available

See TODO for planned features.

The CHANGES file contains a list of changes between versions.

== Installation

Note that id3lib has to be installed before running any of the following
commands, unless you use the Windows binary gem.

Installation through RubyGems:

  gem install id3lib-ruby

Manual installation:

  ruby setup.rb


== Usage

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'id3lib'
  
  # Load a tag from a file
  tag = ID3Lib::Tag.new("talk.mp3")
  
  # Get and set text frames
  tag.text(:title)  #=> "Talk"
  tag.set_text(:album, "X&Y")
  tag.set_text(:track, '5/13')
  
  # Tag is a subclass of Array and holds Frame objects
  p tag[0]
  #=> #<ID3Lib::Frame:TPE1 textenc=0, text="Coldplay">
  
  # Get the number of frames
  tag.length  #=> 7
  
  # Remove all comment frames
  tag.remove_frame(:comment)
  
  # Create new APIC frame and find out which fields are allowed
  apic = ID3Lib::Frame.new(:APIC)
  p apic.allowed_fields
  #=> [:textenc, :mimetype, :picturetype, :description, :data]
  
  # Set the fields and append to tag
  apic.description = "A pretty picture"
  apic.textenc     = 0
  apic.data        = File.read("cover.jpg")
  apic.mimetype    = 'image/jpeg'
  apic.picturetype = 3
  tag << apic
