= id3lib-ruby installation instructions

== Windows

There are precompiled binary gems available for Windows, so the installation
is as simple as typing the following and selecting the newest mswin32 gem:

  gem install id3lib-ruby

== OS X with Fink

Install id3lib4-dev through fink:

  sudo fink install id3lib4-dev

Fink installs the header and library files in /sw, so this is necessary:

  export CONFIGURE_ARGS="--with-opt-dir=/sw"

Then either use RubyGems or setup.rb.

== Gentoo

  sudo emerge --noreplace id3lib

== Debian

  sudo aptitude install libid3-dev

== Others

Download id3lib from http://id3lib.sourceforge.net and unpack it. Then do:

  ./configure && make
  sudo make install

  export CONFIGURE_ARGS="--with-opt-dir=/usr/local"
