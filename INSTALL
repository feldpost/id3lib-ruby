= id3lib-ruby installation instructions

== Binary package (Windows)

There are precompiled binary gems available for Windows, so the installation
is as simple as typing the following and selecting the newest mswin32 gem:

  gem install id3lib-ruby

== Source package

For other systems, there is a RubyGems package or a compressed archive.

=== Prerequisites

Before installing id3lib-ruby, you need to install the underlying id3lib
library and, depending on your system, set CONFIGURE_ARGS.

==== Debian

Install <code>libid3-dev</code> and be sure to have <code>ruby1.8-dev</code>
installed, otherwise you won't be able to build Ruby extensions.

  sudo aptitude install libid3-dev

==== Gentoo

  sudo emerge --noreplace id3lib

==== OS X with Fink

Install <code>id3lib4-dev</code>:

  sudo fink install id3lib4-dev

Fink puts the library and header files in <code>/sw</code>. In order to
enable the id3lib-ruby install program to find them, do:

  export CONFIGURE_ARGS="--with-opt-dir=/sw"

==== Manual compilation

Download, compile and install id3lib. When installing in
<code>/usr/local</code>, you have to set CONFIGURE_ARGS:

  export CONFIGURE_ARGS="--with-opt-dir=/usr/local"

=== Installing id3lib-ruby

Now you're ready to install id3lib-ruby. If you use RubyGems, run the
following and select the newest version marked "ruby":

  sudo gem install id3lib-ruby

Or if you install from the archive, unpack it and do:

  sudo ruby setup.rb
